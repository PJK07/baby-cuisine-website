**Learning:** In React components like `Shop.tsx`, calling methods like `products.filter(...)` inside the `.map` render loop of categories and items creates O(N*M) time complexity recalculations on every single render. When rendering a shop with many items and categories, this blocks the main thread.
**Action:** Extract expensive calculations out of render mapping loops and memoize them in `useMemo` as `Record<string, ...>` dictionary lookups to keep render cycles at O(1) time complexity.

## 2024-05-25 - Avoid Undefined Variables in useMemo Optimizations
**Learning:** When extracting expensive operations out of loops into a dictionary/hash map lookup using `useMemo` (e.g. `categoryProductsByItem`), ensure that the new memoized variable is initialized and defined _before_ any other `useMemo` block tries to reference it, otherwise a critical `ReferenceError` will crash the application.
**Action:** Always check that the declaration of the dictionary variable exists and appears prior to its usage in other hooks.

## 2026-05-23 - Lazy Load Off-Screen Images for Performance
**Learning:** In e-commerce views with a large grid of items (like a menu or catalog), images mapped within list iterations render eagerly by default, causing many unnecessary image network requests for items off-screen. This increases initial page load size, blocking main thread resources and lowering performance.
**Action:** Always add `loading="lazy"` to `<img />` tags inside list components that may render out of the viewport on initial load.
